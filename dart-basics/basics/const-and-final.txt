-- Comparing the keywords --

const String personConst = 'Jeroen';
final String personFinal = 'Jeroen';
personConst = 'Bob'; // Not allowed
personFinal = 'Bob'; // Not allowed
In the code above we create a const and a final variable and assign my name to both. You can’t re-assign both of them.

But what is the difference?

-- final --

- A variable with the final keyword will be initialized at runtime and can only be assigned for a single time.
- In a class and function, you can define a final variable.

-- const --

- A variable with the const keyword is initialized at compile-time and is already assigned when at runtime.
- You can’t define const inside a class. But you can in a function.
- For Flutter specific, everything in the build method won’t be initialized again when the state is updated.
- const can’t be changed during runtime.


When to use which keyword?
A simple example for both:

Use final: If you don’t know what it’s value will be at compile-time. For example, when you can need to get data from an API, this happens when running your code.
Use const: If you are sure that a value isn’t going to be changed when running your code. For example, when you declare a sentence that always remains the same.
